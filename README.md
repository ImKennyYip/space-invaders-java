# [Space Invaders](https://youtu.be/UILUMvjLEVU)
In this tutorial, you will learn how to code space invaders with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library. 

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create the game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to move the ship and fire bullets, randomly generate space invader aliens and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the bullets and aliens, and add a running score. In addition, you will learn how to reset the game and randomly generate aliens of different colors every time a set of aliens have been cleared.

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. You can add additional features to the game, such as letting the aliens fire bullets at you, or giving the aliens health points (HP) so that certain aliens can take more than one bullet. Another feature you can add is keeping track of the high score every time the player resets the game.
